/**
 * Eager local-play-stats updater.
 *
 * When a scrobble fires (song played to completion, exclusions passed), we
 * mutate the local copies of the song and its album everywhere they live so
 * the UI reflects the new play count + last-played date without waiting for
 * a server round-trip. Pull-to-refresh on any of these stores replaces the
 * local blob with the server response, so reconciliation is automatic: if
 * the server is ahead, the local values are overwritten; if the server is
 * still catching up, the local eager values carry until the next refresh.
 *
 * This module has a single public entry point, `applyLocalPlay(song)`, that
 * fans out to every store that may hold a copy of the row. Stores no-op
 * when the row isn't present — there is nothing to update, hence nothing to
 * go stale.
